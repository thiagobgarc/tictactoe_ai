# tictactoe_ai

## Summary
```
I am currently learning about AI and Machine Learning. The best way to learn about AI in a fun
engaging way is to write games like tic-tac-toe. In my recent studies I learned about minimax
algorithm and found a useful tuttorial to implement it in action. It has helped me to understand
the algorithm.
